This documentation exists for the PREPHUB-Screen, which displays a carousel of images on the Raspberry Pi.

All images are set to 1000 x 1000 pixels, so if the images are not all the same size, you need to set a default size to the carousel doesn't look weird when having different sized images.

To replace an image on the carousel, you need to simply point the src attribute of an img file to point to either a static or online picture.

To add another image on the carousel, you need to create a new carousel-item. Follow the examples on

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/

to get started.

The version of bootstrap we are using is 4.0.
