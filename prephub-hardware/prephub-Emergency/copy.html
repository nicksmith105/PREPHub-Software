        <b>After the Earthquake:</b>
        <li>Expect aftershocks. Each time you feel an aftershock, drop, cover and hold on.</li>
        <li>Check yourself for injuries and get first aid if necessary before helping others.</li>
        <li>There may be a lot of broken glass and debris. Protect your head, feet and hands.</li>
        <li>Check the natural gas or propane at your house. Shut it off if smells like gas (rotten eggs).</li>
        <li>Shut off water at the curbside to trap the clean water thatâ€™s in your pipes and keep pollutants out.</li>
        <li>Get everyone out of your home.</li>
        <li>Watch for fallen power lines or broken gas lines; stay out of damaged areas.</li>
        <li>Text your contacts to let them know you are safe.</li>
        <li>Check on your neighbors.</li>
        <li>If you are trapped in the house, use your whistle or bang something to call for help.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Other potential hazards:</b>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>If you smell a gas leak, shut off the main gas valve if you can. Go outside and wait for the gas smell to
          go  away. Call the utility company to turn gas back on.</li>
        <li>Shut off power at the breaker box if electrical wiring is damaged. Leave the power off until damage is
          repaired.
        </li>
        <li>Stay away from chimneys and walls made of brick. They could topple during an aftershock.</li>
