What is PREPHub?

PREPHub is designed as a meeting site in the event of natural disasters. Each PREPHub comes with food and safety supplies, audio system, PV Panel, USB Charging port, and a pedal-powered generator. 

Project Mission

Over the course of six months, our team set out to develop an interactive web app to allow curious pedestrians to interact with the Hub. Along with relevant information, the web app includes features for various user-interactions (i.e. ability to play music, or configuring the coloring scheme of LED lights embedded in the Hub). We decided to include a parser to filter RSS feeds for emergencies and change the state of the Hub based on keywords in the feed.

Project Features
- Raspberry Pi OS: Develop Operating System on Pi to interface with lighting, sound, and server
- Dynamic Webpage: A web app that displays emergency information and allows users to change lights and music 
- Parse Emergency Alerts: Web app and lights change based on information passed through Portland States RSS feed
- Emergency Mode: In case of an emergency the LED lights turn amber-red to alert pedestrians 
- Sound Alerts: speakers will be able to cycle between popular radio stations in Portland, Oregon. In case of an emergency, the speakers will play a pre-recorded message warning pedestrians of a potential threat
